## Features

### Task 1 – VPython

* Two balls bouncing along x-axis
* Two balls bouncing along y-axis
* Smooth animations using `rate()`

### Task 2 – Ursina

* Player moves using **WASD**
* Interactive **button** that opens a **sliding door**
* Camera follows the player

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```

2. **Install required packages**

```bash
pip install ursina vpython
```

3. **Run the projects**

* **Task 1 (VPython)**

```bash
